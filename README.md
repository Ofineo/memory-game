# Memory Game Project


* [Instructions](#instructions)

## Instructions

The game is also known as Concentration, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso and Pairs.
Choose a card and click on it. That will turn it over to show you the symbol.
Then select another card and turn it over. If the two cards are a matching pair for example two diamonds then they will stay turned. 
If the cards are not a match they will be turned back over.
try to memorize them as they show and find the pairs as quickly as possible.

there is a timer to show you how long it took you to match all the cards and a star rating that will go down the longer you take to win.

You can always reset the game with the reset button or play more than one time.

##Dependencies

This game is developed in Javascript but it has a dependency on JQuery therefore you will have to play online as I decided not to have the library locally.
